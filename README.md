#click here https://jagadish-gandi.github.io/Moviesearch.io/      *This is an updated HTML code for a website called "MovieSearch.com". It includes a search bar where users can enter the name of a movie they are looking for, and the website will display the search results using The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The website has been styled using CSS and includes a custom font, background color, and layout. The search results are displayed in a grid format with each movie displayed in its own "movie" div, containing the movie title, a brief overview, and a poster image. The code has also been optimized for mobile devices, with the search input width set to 100% on small screens. This code is meant to be uploaded onto a website hosting service such as GitHub Pages to make it accessible online.
